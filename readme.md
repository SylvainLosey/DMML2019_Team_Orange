## IMDB Movie reviews - Sentiment analysis
For the semester project we have decided to choose a topic of sentiment analysis for movie reviews from the movie database IMDb. We want to write a program that indicates if a movie review is positive or negative.

### Dataset
We have chosen to use a dataset from Stanford which includes 50â€™000 different movie reviews from IMDb, you can find it here: http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/ . The reviews are highly polarized, which should help us to have a more reliable model. 

### Instructions
Run `main.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab to get started.

The first code block will install the required dependencies.
