## IMDB Movie reviews - Sentiment analysis
For the semester project we have decided to choose a topic of sentiment analysis for movie reviews from the movie database IMDb. We want to write a program that indicates if a movie review is positive or negative. In addition, the goal would be to identify the best technique to use for the sentiment analysis of movie reviews and to compare the results obtained from these techniques. In the project we have decided to focus on three main techniques: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and KNN-neighbours

### Dataset
We have chosen to use a dataset from Kaggle, which is available through the link here: https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews as it provides a combined database of 50'000 movie reviews from IMDb. The reviews are highly polarized, which should help us to have a more reliable model. The dataset is available for further information in .csv format as IMDB Dataset in the data folder.

### Instructions
The code for the project is available under `main.ipynb` in the code folder which is possible to run in Jupyter or Google Colab to get started. The notebook is in general separated into main blocks:
1. The first code block will install the required dependencies
2. The second block will have EDA processing of the dataset
3. The third block will show the methods used in the analysis
4. The final block will present the conclusions and recommendation drawn from the project
