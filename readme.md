## IMDB Movie reviews - Sentiment analysis
For the semester project we have decided to choose a topic of sentiment analysis for movie reviews from the movie database IMDb. We want to write a program that indicates if a movie review is positive (user liked the movie) or negative (user didn’t like the movie).

### Dataset
We have chosen to use a dataset from Stanford which includes 50’000 different movie reviews from IMDb, you can find it here: http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/ . The reviews are highly polarized, which should help us to have a more reliable model.
