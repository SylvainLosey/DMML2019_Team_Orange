    "##### Tokenization and stopword removal\n",
    "The next thing we do is tokenizing the text, which means transforming the reviews (type: string) to list of words. After that, we removed the stopwords from our reviews, since they don't have any importance for our analysis. We used the predefined stopword list provided by spacy, that we adapted to our specific task by removing words from it that are crucial for our analysis (for example: \"not\", \"never\", \"very\") and therefore shouldn't be added to the stopword list.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Entity removal\n",
    "In our task the most represented entities are : name of characters, name of actors / directors and locations. Even though we acknowledge the fact that the success of a movie might be highly correlated with the actors starring in it, the director that shot it or the characters involved, we wanted our code to be as general as possible and our results not to depend on the names of the people that made the movie. \n",
    "That's why we decided to remove all entities from our reviews.\n",
    "##### Lemmatization\n",
